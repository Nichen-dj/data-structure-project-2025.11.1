quantum computing leverages the principles of quantum mechanicssuch as superposition and entanglementto process information in ways that classical computers cannot unlike classical bits which represent either 0 or 1 quantum bits qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously enabling quantum computers to solve complex problems far faster key applications of quantum computing include breaking traditional encryption optimizing supply chains and simulating molecular structures for drug discovery for example pharmaceutical companies use quantum simulators to model how potential drugs interact with proteins significantly reducing the time needed to develop new treatments however quantum computers face major challenges they require extremely low temperatures near absolute zero to operate and qubits are highly sensitive to environmental interference called decoherence researchers are developing errorcorrecting codes and more stable qubit designs to address these issues as of 2025 leading tech companies like ibm google and microsoft have built quantum processors with dozens of qubits but largescale practical quantum computers are still years away
