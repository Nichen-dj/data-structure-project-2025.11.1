Artificial Intelligence (AI) ethics focuses on the moral principles and guidelines that govern the development and use of AI systems. As AI becomes more integrated into daily life—from hiring algorithms and facial recognition to healthcare diagnostics—concerns about bias, privacy, and accountability have grown.

One of the most pressing ethical issues is algorithmic bias. AI systems learn from historical data, which may contain hidden biases (e.g., racial or gender-based discrimination). For example, a hiring algorithm trained on data from a male-dominated workforce might prioritize male candidates over equally qualified female candidates. To address this, researchers are developing "fair AI" techniques, such as reweighting training data to balance representation and auditing algorithms for bias before deployment.

Privacy is another major concern. AI systems often rely on large amounts of personal data (e.g., medical records, social media activity) to function. Without proper safeguards, this data can be misused or leaked, violating individual privacy rights. Regulations like the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) require companies to obtain explicit consent for data collection and to inform users how their data will be used.

Accountability is also challenging: when an AI system makes a harmful decision (e.g., a self-driving car causing an accident or a medical AI misdiagnosing a patient), it is often unclear who is responsible—the developer, the user, or the company that deployed the system. Many experts argue that AI systems should be "explainable" (XAI)—able to provide clear, human-understandable reasons for their decisions—to improve accountability.

To promote ethical AI, governments, tech companies, and academic institutions are collaborating to create frameworks and standards. For example, the OECD’s AI Principles emphasize transparency, fairness, and human oversight, while companies like Google and Microsoft have established internal AI ethics boards to review high-risk projects.
