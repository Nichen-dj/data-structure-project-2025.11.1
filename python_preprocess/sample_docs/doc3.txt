Space exploration is the investigation of celestial bodies beyond Earth’s atmosphere, including the moon, planets, and stars. It combines science, technology, and engineering to expand human knowledge of the universe and potentially find habitable environments outside our planet.

The first major milestone in space exploration was the launch of Sputnik 1 by the Soviet Union in 1957, marking the start of the Space Age. In 1969, NASA’s Apollo 11 mission landed the first humans on the moon, a historic achievement watched by millions worldwide. Today, agencies like NASA, ESA, and SpaceX are working on more ambitious projects, such as sending humans to Mars and building a permanent lunar base.

Space exploration also drives technological innovation. Many everyday technologies, including GPS, satellite communication, and even memory foam, were originally developed for space missions. These innovations improve quality of life on Earth while supporting future space endeavors.
