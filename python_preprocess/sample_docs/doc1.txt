Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning, reasoning, and self-correction. Over the past decade, AI has made significant advancements in various fields, such as healthcare, finance, and transportation.

In healthcare, AI-powered tools can analyze medical images to detect diseases like cancer at an early stage, improving patient survival rates. In finance, algorithms use AI to predict market trends and manage investment portfolios more efficiently. Additionally, self-driving cars rely on AI to process real-time data from sensors and make safe driving decisions.

Despite its benefits, AI also raises ethical concerns, such as job displacement and privacy issues. Experts argue that responsible development and regulation of AI are essential to ensure it benefits society as a whole.
