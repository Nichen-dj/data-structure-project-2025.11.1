Climate change is a long-term shift in global or regional weather patterns, primarily caused by human activities like burning fossil fuels and deforestation. These activities release greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), into the atmosphere, trapping heat and raising global temperatures.

The effects of climate change are becoming increasingly visible: rising sea levels threaten coastal communities, extreme weather events like hurricanes and droughts are becoming more frequent, and ecosystems are struggling to adapt. For example, polar ice caps are melting at an accelerated rate, endangering species like polar bears.

To address climate change, governments and organizations worldwide are promoting renewable energy sources like solar and wind power. Individuals can also contribute by reducing their carbon footprint—for instance, using public transportation, conserving energy at home, and recycling waste.
