Quantum computing leverages the principles of quantum mechanics—such as superposition and entanglement—to process information in ways that classical computers cannot. Unlike classical bits, which represent either 0 or 1, quantum bits (qubits) can exist in multiple states simultaneously, enabling quantum computers to solve complex problems far faster.

Key applications of quantum computing include breaking traditional encryption, optimizing supply chains, and simulating molecular structures for drug discovery. For example, pharmaceutical companies use quantum simulators to model how potential drugs interact with proteins, significantly reducing the time needed to develop new treatments.

However, quantum computers face major challenges: they require extremely low temperatures (near absolute zero) to operate, and qubits are highly sensitive to environmental interference (called "decoherence"). Researchers are developing error-correcting codes and more stable qubit designs to address these issues. As of 2025, leading tech companies like IBM, Google, and Microsoft have built quantum processors with dozens of qubits, but large-scale, practical quantum computers are still years away.
